# Start.bat
A python version of the start.bat file for minecraft servers

### what does it offer?
it has a decent amount of features for a python program coded in 2 hours.

- [x] Config file
- [x] Kinda manual non ip leaking free port forwarding
- [x] Finds the jar file automatically
- [x] Finds if you have the good version of java to run the jar (although its very scuffed)
- [x] Set the amount of ram in GB without much hassle ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## TODO list:

- [ ] make a automatic server downloader

<br>
## how to run it
double click it, no need to go in terminal and stuff
